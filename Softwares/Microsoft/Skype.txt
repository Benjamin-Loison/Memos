get public ipv4 of a user:

Launch wireshark and filter: !(udp.port == 9987) && !(udp.port == 443) && udp && ip.src == 192.168.1.43 && stun && frame.cap_len >= 114 && frame.cap_len <= 200
and call someone (doesn't need to answer but need to be in your contact otherwise if not friend and user answer to the call we will reach an ip in Redmond (USA) of the Skype office)

work ? can get internal ipv4 of the other user: (with a call without answer) stun && !icmp && ip.src == 192.168.1.43 && frame.cap_len >= 114 && frame.cap_len <= 200

get computer local users: cd %appdata%/Skype & dir
or: powershell cd %appdata%/Skype & Get-Content shared.xml -Head 10 (need to see </Account> at the end)
