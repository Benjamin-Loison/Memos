Auto-mount on reboot:

sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
Press O and press Enter (creates a new table)
Press N and press Enter (creates a new partition)
Press P and press Enter (makes a primary partition)
Then press 1 and press Enter (creates it as the 1st partition)
Finally, press W (this will write any changes to disk)
Run sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
You need to add it to /etc/fstab use your favourite text editor
Be careful with this file as it can quite easily cause your system not to boot.
Add a line for the drive, the format would look like this.
This assumes the partition is formatted as ext4 as per mkfs above
#device        mountpoint             fstype    options  dump   fsck
/dev/sdb1    /home/yourname/mydata    ext4    defaults    0    1

Passion for "toto" on linux (for instance, for a user)

Big simple (without symbol like ") content to put in a file ? echo "FAT
FAT
FAT" > your.file

(no need of a text editor)
