I have never seen such a website which is so source-code displayed in the french version... You shouldn't earn a single dollar for such a shitty job. I don't know how the english version is looking but such a french version is an insult for french people. "Testeur de stylos"... NO BUT SERIOUSLY HAVE YOU EVEN PAID A TRANSLATOR JUST TO CHECK ?! PEN TESTESTER IS NOT A PEN USER !!!!!!
