man iptables

       -L, --list [chain]
              List all rules in the selected chain.  If no chain is selected, all chains are listed. Like every other iptables command, it applies to the specified table (filter is the default), so NAT rules get listed by
               iptables -t nat -n -L
              Please note that it is often used with the -n option, in order to avoid long reverse DNS lookups.  It is legal to specify the -Z (zero) option as well, in which case the chain(s) will be atomically listed and zeroed.  The exact output is affected by the other arguments given.  The  exact  rules
              are suppressed until you use
               iptables -L -v
              or iptables-save(8). <--- what does it mean ?

still a problem: dig srv _minecraft._tcp.altiscraft.fr (get ip)
otherwise next version: don't care same ip for website (redirect web traffic with intermédiaire OVH iptables) and configure a program coded by myself to send to the server what clients sent (send to the real game server with their IP) and then the server game send back to the intermédiaire who is it destinated) or do not use intermédiaire and don't care about ip
